- Energy is the quantity that all objects possess and is what is needed to do work
	- Energy is a scalar quantity and uses joules
	- Comes in the form of sound, heat, light, kinetic, potential
- Work is a transfer of energy from one place or one object to another
$$
W=Fs\cos \theta
$$
- Work can be positive or negative
	- Positive when there is a net gain in energy
	- Negative when there is a net loss in energy
# Practice problems
1. A 10kg box is pushed for 5 metres at a constant speed over a timber floor that has a frictional coefficient of 0.4
	1. What work is done on the box by pushing it?
	2. What work is done on the box by the frictional force?
2. How much work is done on a 20kg box in the following cases if it is:
	1. pushed 5m across a smooth floor with a force of 300N
	2. lifted to a height of 2m and then carried for 10m
	3. pushed for 20m around the room until it returns to its starting point?
