- Energy is the quantity that all objects possess and is what is needed to do work
	- Energy is a scalar quantity and uses joules
	- Comes in the form of sound, heat, light, kinetic, potential
- Work is a transfer of energy from one place or one object to another
$$
W=Fs\cos \theta
$$
- Work can be positive or negative
	- Positive when there is a net gain in energy
	- Negative when there is a net loss in energy

1. A 10kg box is pushed for 5 metres at a constant speed over a timber floor that has a frictional coefficient of 0.4
	1. What work is done on the box by pushing it?
	2. What work is done on the box by the frictional force?
