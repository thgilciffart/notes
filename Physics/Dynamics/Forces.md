- Forces are vector quantities
- Forces make things
	- Accelerate
	- Decelerate
	- Change direction
- Newtons

# Four fundamental forces
- Strong nuclear force
- Weak nuclear force
- Electromagnetic force
- Gravity
# Balanced forces
- An object at rest or uniform motion is said to be acted upon by forces that are in a balance.
- In other words, the sum of forces add to zero.
# Newtons 3 laws
## 1. Law of inertia
- Every object remains stationary unless that state is changed by the action of external force
- An object will maintain a constant velocity unless an unbalanced force acts on it.
- An objects tendency to stay in its state of motion
- Mass is a measure of an object's inertia
- Mass is measured in kilograms
## 2. Acceleration proportional to force
- The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force on the object and inversely proportional to the mass of the object
$$
F=ma
$$
## 3. Equal opposite reaction
- For every action, there is an equal opposite reaction
# Mass and weight
- Mass is a measure of an objects inertia (kilograms)
- Weight is the force of gravity acting upon an object and is measured in Newtons
- Weight changes with gravity, but mass doesn't.
# Normal force
- contact forces are exerted perpendicular to the surface

# Practice Questions

$$\begin{aligned}
\text{1) On the surface of Mars, the gravitational acceleration is} approximately 3.7m/s/s. What would be the weight of an astronaut in full EVA suit on Mars if the total mass was 130kg?
\end{aligned}
