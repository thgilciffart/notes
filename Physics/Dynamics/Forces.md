- Forces make things
	- Accelerate
	- Decelerate
	- Change direction
- Newtons

# Four fundamental forces
- Strong nuclear force
- Weak nuclear force
- Electromagnetic force
- Gravity
# Balanced forces
- An object at rest or uniform motion is said to be acted upon by forces that are in a balance.
- In other words, the sum of forces add to zero.
# Newtons 3 laws
## 1. Law of inertia
- Every object remains stationary unless that state is changed by the action of external force
- An object will maintain a constant velocity unless an unbalanced force acts on it.
- An objects tendency to stay in its state of motion
- Mass is a measure of an object's inertia
- Mass is measured in kilograms
## 2. Acceleration proportional to force
- The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force on the object and inversely proportional to the mass of the object
$$
F=ma
$$
## 3. Equal opposite reaction
- For every action, there is an equal opposite reaction
# Mass and weight
- Mass is a measure of an objects inertia (kilograms)
- Weight is the force of gravity acting upon an object and is measured in Newtons
- Weight changes with gravity, but mass doesn't.
# Normal force
- contact forces are exerted perpendicular to the surface

# Practice Questions
1. What force would be needed to make an object of 3kg accelerate at 1.6m/s/s
$$\begin{aligned}
F &=ma \\
F &=3\cdot 1.6ms^{-2} \\
F &=4.8N
\end{aligned}

$$
2. A force 9.1N was applied to a box of mass 0.7kg resting on a smooth horizontal surface. What acceleration is expected?
$$\begin{aligned}
F&=ma \\
9.1N&=0.7a \\
a&=\frac{9.1}{0.7} \\
a&=13ms^{-2}
\end{aligned}
$$
3. An acceleration of 17m/s/s was produced when a force of 0.85N was applied to a body. What was the mass of the body?
$$\begin{aligned}
F&=ma \\
0.85&=m17ms^{-2} \\
m&=\frac{0.85}{17} \\
m&=0.05kg
\end{aligned}
$$
4. A sports car of mass 550kg accelerated from rest to 45m/s in 5.0s. What net force must have been applied to produce this acceleration?
$$\begin{aligned}
F&=ma \\
F&=550\cdot 9ms^{-2} \\
F&=4950N
\end{aligned}

$$
5. A rocket travelling at 55 m/s fired its motor which gave a thrust of 1880N. At the end of 6.2s, its velocity was 637.8m/s. What was the mass of the rocket during the process?
$$\begin{aligned}
a&=\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} \\
a&=\frac{582.8}{6.2} \\
a&=94ms^{-2} \\
F&=ma \\
\frac{F}{a}&=m \\
m&=\frac{1880}{94} \\
m&=20kg
\end{aligned}

$$
