# Stoichiometry
- The study of quantitative relationships / ratios in chemical reactions
	- Involves the amounts of reactants used and of products produced
# Balancing equations
When balancing equations, the number of each atom has to be equal on both side
## Practice

$$
\ce{ 2KRr }+\ce{ CI }_{2} \to \ce{ 2KCI }+\ce{ Br }_{2}
$$
$$
\ce{ 2ZnS }+ 2\ce{O }_{2}\to 2\ce{ ZnO }+2\ce{ SO }_{2}
$$
$$
\ce{C}_{3}\ce{ H }_{8} + \ce{ O }_{2} \to \ce{ H }_{2}\ce{ O }+\ce{ CO }_{2}
$$
$$
\ce{ Pb }(\ce{ NO }_{3})_{2}+\ce{ NaCl }\to \ce{ NaNO }_{3}+\ce{ PbCl }_{2}
$$
1. A solution of phosphoric acid is neutralised with sodium hydroxide solution, forming sodium phosphate and water
2. When a wire made of copper metal is placed in a solution of silver nitrate, silver metal is deposited on the wire and the solution turns blue due to the copper II nitrate being formed
$$
\ce{ Cu }_{s}+(\ce{ AgNO }_{3})_{s}\to \ce{ Cu }+
$$
3. The combustion of propane gas with gaseous oxygen gives carbon dioxide and water vapour
$$
\ce{ C_{3}H_{8} }_{(g)}+\ce{ 5O_{2} }_{(g)}\to \ce{ 3CO_{2} }_{(g)}+\ce{ 4H2O }_{(g)}
$$
4. When a colourless solution of potassium iodide is mixed with a colourless solution of lead(II) nitrate, the yellow precipitate lead(II) iodide forms. Potassium nitrate remains dissolved in solution
5. Iron (III) oxide can be reduced by carbon monoxide gas to form iron metal and carbon dioxide gas
6. Aluminium oxide reacts with hydrofluoric acid to give aluminium trifluoride and water
7. The treatment of manganese (IV) oxide with concentrated hydrochloric acid yields manganese (II) chloride, water and chlorine gas.
8. Methane, ammonia and oxygen gas can be reacted together to form hydrogen cyanide and water
9. Diammonium hydrogen phosphate reacts with copper (II) oxide to give copper(II) phosphate, water and ammonia
$$
\ce{ (NH_{4})_{2} }
