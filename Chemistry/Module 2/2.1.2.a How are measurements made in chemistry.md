# Stoichiometry
- The study of quantitative relationships / ratios in chemical reactions
	- Involves the amounts of reactants used and of products produced
# Balancing equations
When balancing equations, the number of each atom has to be equal on both side
## Practice

$$
\ce{ 2KRr }+\ce{ CI }_{2} \to \ce{ 2KCI }+\ce{ Br }_{2}
$$
$$
\ce{ 2ZnS }+ 2\ce{O }_{2}\to 2\ce{ ZnO }+2\ce{ SO }_{2}
$$
$$
\ce{C}_{3}\ce{ H }_{8} + \ce{ O }_{2} \to \ce{ H }_{2}\ce{ O }+\ce{ CO }_{2}
$$
$$
\ce{ Pb }(\ce{ NO }_{3})_{2}+\ce{ NaCl }\to \ce{ NaNO }_{3}+\ce{ PbCl }_{2}
$$
1. A solution of phosphoric acid is neutralised with sodium hydroxide solution, forming sodium phosphate and water
2. When a wire made of copper metal is placed in a solution of silver nitrate, silver metal is deposited on the wire and the solution turns blue due to the copper II nitrate being formed
3.
