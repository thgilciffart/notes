1. Point P on a Ferris wheel is modelled by the equation, where h is the metres above the ground and time is in minutes. 
$$
h(t)=65-55\cos\left( \frac{\pi t}{15} \right)
$$
$$\begin{aligned}
&\text{i) State the maximum and minimum heights of P? }  \\
&\text{ii) How much time is one revolution? }  \\
&\text{iii) Find the rate of change of h with respect to t and state the value of which results in} \\
&\text{the maximum rate of change}
\end{aligned}
$$
